show everyone on map

first person to click on capture point within radius sends the initial capture request

this starts the timer on the server side

variables:
	timer: remaining time
	team: which team is capturing

other players can chime in by clicking on the capture point

server side:
	while 5 seconds not over
	check numbers for both teams
		check if they left, if they have, then remove them from the capturing count for that team
	if more numbers on other side, reset timer, and team variable
		and update every player

	update every player the state of the capture point(s) every half second or so
