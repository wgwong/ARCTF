player id - (identify phones)
//prob player object
	//with member fields id, team, location, etc.

store location of every player currently connected
	store an array of locations for EACH player (to handle jumping)

CAP players to like x per game

send location of everyone to phone (every x time interval)



handle disconnects:
	every phone connected has to send location, sesskey, id every 5 seconds
	if server doesnt receive this "heartbeat" from a phone more than 3 times, then it pronounces the phone as "disconnected" and handles all server stuff accordingly and then sends the update to that d/c phone's team

	if phone still receives game data from server:
		phone should see that it 



phone creates lobby, connects to server to create a lobby, sends phone id, loc
server returns lobby sess key to phone as well as indicating that the phone is the owner
	so returns lobby sess key, and var owner: phone id that indicates which phone is owner

other phones connect to server looking for a lobby, server returns list of nearby lobbies
phones choose a lobby to connect to, upon button press, connects to that lobby, sends phone id, loc
server returns lobby sess key
each time server receives a new connection from a non-owner phone, server pushes list of connected phone ids to owner
	this should propogate onto owner phone's screen
	when num of players > i, then the "start game" button is enabled
	when owner presses start game, server updates status on that particular game
		start game timer and other shit
		notifies all players that the game has started
		another message for nearby capture points
		another message for list of team members and their location

		when phone receives this, phone starts a game loop, starts sending above data every interval


//current sprint

phone sends mac address (id) and location
to route A

server receives this, sends back hardcoded sess key
also sends back notification that game has started
	with this notification, give a list of nearby capture points

phone receives sess key, begins game loop (without waiting for lobby)

	in phone game loop
		send server (same as above) loc data, sess key, id

	server game loop
		periodically send all connected phones data about
			list of phone loc for their team (including themselves)

	after a certain time, send a game over msg to all players
		send information about the status of the game:
			each team score
